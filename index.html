	<h1>Unit 2: Design Challenge</h1>
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
			<p><a href=https://www.behance.net/gallery/Noma-Authentic-Website-App/7675951>Noma Authentic</a> and <a href=http://www.kinfolk.com/>Kinfolk Magazine</a></p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
			<p>Noma Authentic is a design mockup of a website for the restaurant in Norway. It uses a lot of clear space balanced with visually rich imagery. The typography is a mix of minimal and modern, with a nod to the traditional with the use of the serif typeface for the body copy, subheads and navigation accents. Large images of Norwegian landscapes takes the forefront, with clear hierarchy between content and links.</p>

			<p>Kinfolk Magazine is a responsive website that features various articles/content. It also employs a simple, minimalist approach, with large hero images. I like this approach as it gives importance to the content and not to unnecessary fluff or filler. The typography is also a combination of vintage and modern and it employs a predominantly monochromatic color palette with accents of red for small links. The site is extremely balanced and employs use of spacial awareness in the top slider so that the user can see that there is more content to scroll through to the right.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
			<p>Their UI design is very similar, as is the photography style, but they are structured very differently. With different site objectives comes different navigation, content strategy and user flows.
		<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>
			<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Homepage Wireframe 1:</strong><br>
			<p>A website for a tour company that runs small, boutique tours in Morocco. This wireframe features a different nav and a featured tour. By simplifying the nav and removing extraneous elements, I hope to make the tour content the main focus of the site.</p>

			<li><p><strong>Homepage Wireframe 2:</strong><br>
			<p>This wireframe features a different nav and 3 featured tours. It provides a broader initial snapshot of the tours available.</p>
